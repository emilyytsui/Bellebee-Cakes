        <h2>Silver Lining Missions | $500</h2>
        <p>
          During the 2020 winter break, we generated $500 and on December 31,
          2020, we donated all proceeds to Silver Lining Missions, "a registered
          non-profit organization in the USA that is chartered with the purpose
          to support the charity and humanitarian works in China, Myanmar, and
          Vietnam focused on minority orphans, disabled, cerebral palsy
          children, and their families." With this donation, Silver Lining is
          able to supply 10 children with 10 sets of school supplies and 5
          children with 5 sets of winter clothing. This means that 15 children
          in Myanmar will have a special gift to use throughout the year! Thank
          you all for the support.

        <h2>FCBA, PCF | $1800</h2>
        <p>
          On April 13, 2021, I went to a press conference in Flushing, NY, to
          talk about my donations and my experience with selling my cakes to
          raise money. In total, we were able to donate $1800 to Prosperous
          Community Foundation (PCF), which is a non-profit organization (a
          division of the International Police & Veterans Foundation, IPVForg)
          that was established to empower the citizens of every neighborhood
          with the skills and knowledge to create safer and more resilient
          communities. You all helped me raise $600 and my parents wanted to
          match that amount so we got to $1200. Then, the presidents of FCBA
          wanted to match as well so we got up to $1800! The story is featured
          in some Chinese articles and in the World Journal newspaper as well.
          Thank you all for everything and please keep supporting me in the
          future!
